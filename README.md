# Numerical-Analysis
This folder contains some examples of code written for various courses and projects.

The numerical quadrature files require an integrand, endpoints and a number of points.

All other files are for specific equations and require only simple inputs, such as the time step, number of points and/or the final time, see comments at the top of any file.
